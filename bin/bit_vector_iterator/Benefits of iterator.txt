1. Used to iterate over BitVector without exposing the internal structure 
2. Provides an interface for accessing and iterating elements
3. In this example although the internal reperesentation is very complex
 as the number in final set are denoted by the position of 1 in the binary reprresentation of 
 integers in words array
 Iterator helps in abstraction over all of the complex logic and gives out
 the final elements in the set
