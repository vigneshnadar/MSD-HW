converts the interface of BitVector into another interface StringSet that clients expect 
Here we want to use an existing class, BitVector and its interface does not match the one we need ▪StringSet

 we need to use several existing subclasses, but it’s impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one.
 The Adapter design pattern helps us in reusing the all the functions of BitVector and give out the
 functionality expected by StringSet
